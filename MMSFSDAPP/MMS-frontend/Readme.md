🔐 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
The Military Asset Management system implements Role-Based Access Control to ensure secure and appropriate access to features and data. Below is a breakdown of how roles, access levels, and security enforcement work.

🧑‍💼 Roles Overview
Role	Description
Admin	🔧 Full control over the entire system, including users and settings.
Base Commander	🪖 Manages operations specific to their assigned base, including approvals.
Logistics Officer	📦 Focused on logistics—transfers and purchases only.

🛂 Access Levels
Full Access – Admins Only

Can view and manage all areas of the system.

Has access to user management and system configuration.

Base-Specific Access – Base Commanders Only

Access limited to assets, transfers, and assignments at their assigned base.

Can approve or cancel asset transfers.

Logistics Operations Access – Logistics Officers Only

Can manage asset transfers and purchases.

Can view logistics-related reports only.

🛡️ Enforcement Method
✅ Authentication
JWT-based authentication is used.

After login, the user receives a JWT token.

This token must be included in all API requests.

🔒 Authorization
The backend verifies the user's JWT token.

The user's role is extracted and checked against the access policy for the requested resource.

👮 Role Verification
Every page or action has a role guard.

Example: Only Admins can access /users and change system settings.

📦 Token Management
Tokens are securely stored in localStorage.

All outgoing API calls include the token in the header.

If a token is missing or invalid, access is denied.

🔁 Session Management
On app load, the token is validated.

If valid, the user session is restored.

If invalid or expired, the user is redirected to /login.
